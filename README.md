 Weight: 5
 Project to be done in teams of 2 people (your team: Moses Daudu)
 
 0. New node
mandatory
Write a function that creates a binary tree node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
And value is the value to put in the new node
When created, a node does not have any child
Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure

1. Insert left
mandatory
Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

2. Insert right
mandatory
Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent

3. Delete
mandatory
Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree

Prototype: void binary_tree_delete(binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to delete
If tree is NULL, do nothing

4. Is leaf
mandatory
Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf

Prototype: int binary_tree_is_leaf(const binary_tree_t *node);
Where node is a pointer to the node to check
Your function must return 1 if node is a leaf, otherwise 0
If node is NULL, return 0

5. Is root
mandatory
Write a function that checks if a given node is a root

Prototype: int binary_tree_is_root(const binary_tree_t *node);
Where node is a pointer to the node to check
Your function must return 1 if node is a root, otherwise 0
If node is NULL, return 0

6. Pre-order traversal
mandatory
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

Prototype: void binary_tree_preorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int));
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
And func is a pointer to a function to call for each node. The value in the node must be passed as a parameter to this function.
If tree or func is NULL, do nothing

7. In-order traversal
mandatory
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

Prototype: void binary_tree_inorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int));
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
And func is a pointer to a function to call for each node. The value in the node must be passed as a parameter to this function.
If tree or func is NULL, do nothing

8. Post-order traversal
mandatory
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal

Prototype: void binary_tree_postorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int));
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
And func is a pointer to a function to call for each node. The value in the node must be passed as a parameter to this function.
If tree or func is NULL, do nothing

9. Height
mandatory
Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree

Prototype: size_t binary_tree_height(const binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to measure the height.
If tree is NULL, your function must return 0
